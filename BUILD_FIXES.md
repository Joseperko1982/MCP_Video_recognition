# Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

1. **Cleaned package.json** - Removed unnecessary MCP metadata and extra scripts that could cause build failures
2. **Fixed index.ts** - Restored proper typing and removed `any` types that could cause TypeScript errors
3. **Simplified scripts** - Removed debug and lint scripts that referenced potentially unavailable packages
4. **Proper MongoDB handling** - Ensured MongoDB URI is required (as per Supermachine requirements)

## Key Changes Made

### package.json
- Removed extra scripts that could fail (debug, lint)
- Simplified to core build requirements
- Removed MCP-specific metadata that isn't needed for build

### src/index.ts  
- Fixed transport type defaulting to 'stdio' instead of 'sse'
- Removed `any` typing for proper TypeScript compilation
- Ensured MongoDB URI is required (not optional)

### TypeScript Configuration
- Verified tsconfig.json is properly configured for ES modules
- Ensured all imports use .js extensions for ES module compatibility

## Build Commands for Supermachine

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables Required

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## Optional Environment Variables

```
MONGODB_DB_NAME=video_analysis
TRANSPORT_TYPE=stdio
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

The repository should now build successfully on Supermachine!

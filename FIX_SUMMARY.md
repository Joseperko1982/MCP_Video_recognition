# Supermachine Deployment Fix

## Problem
The error "Cannot find module '/path/to/dist/index.js'" occurs because:
1. TypeScript projects need to be compiled to JavaScript
2. The `dist` folder (containing compiled JS) doesn't exist until after build
3. Supermachine runs `npm install` but wasn't automatically building the project

## Solution Applied
1. **Added `postinstall` script** to `package.json`
   - Automatically runs `npm run build` after `npm install`
   - No manual build step needed

2. **Moved TypeScript to dependencies**
   - TypeScript and type definitions are now in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`)
   - Ensures they're available in production installations

3. **Created verification script**
   - Run `npm run verify` to check if build completed successfully
   - Checks for all required files and environment variables

## What Changed

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm run build",  // NEW: Auto-builds after install
    "verify": "node verify-build.js"  // NEW: Verify build completed
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.8.3",           // MOVED: From devDependencies
    "@types/express": "^5.0.1",       // MOVED: From devDependencies
    "@types/node": "^22.14.1",        // MOVED: From devDependencies
    "@types/mime-types": "^2.1.4"     // MOVED: From devDependencies
  }
}
```

## Deployment Process Now

1. **Push updated code to GitHub**
2. **In Supermachine**: Add/Update the repository
3. **Automatic process**:
   - Supermachine runs `npm install`
   - `postinstall` triggers `npm run build`
   - TypeScript compiles to `dist` folder
   - Server starts with `npm start`

## Verification
After deployment, check:
- Supermachine logs should show "TypeScript compilation complete"
- Server status should be "Running"
- No "module not found" errors

## If Issues Persist
1. Check Node.js version (must be 18+)
2. Look for build errors in Supermachine logs
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Try running `npm run verify` if you have console access
